| **Project Name** | AgroPulse |
| **Problem Statement ID** | CS03AE |
| **Team Name** | Trikernel |
| **College** | NMAMIT |

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Farmers often lack access to real-time market prices, reliable demand insights, and direct connections with buyers. Current agricultural marketplaces are dominated by middlemen, delayed price updates, and fragmented information sources, which results in:

- ❌ **Unfair pricing** for farmers
- ❌ **Low bargaining power**
- ❌ **Inability to decide** the right time and place to sell produce

This leads to **reduced farmer income** and **inefficient agricultural trade**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

**AgroPulse** is a real-time market intelligence and direct market access platform designed specifically for farmers.

### The platform:

- 📊 **Aggregates live mandi prices** and market data
- 🤖 **Uses AI/ML** to predict price trends and suggest optimal selling times
- 🤝 **Enables direct farmer-to-buyer interaction**, removing middlemen
- ⚡ **Supports real-time bidding**, smart buyer–farmer matching, and transparent pricing

> AgroPulse transforms raw data into actionable intelligence, empowering farmers to make profitable decisions.

## ✨ Innovation & Creativity

What makes AgroPulse unique:

### 📈 Price Prediction Intelligence

### 📱 Farmer-First Design
Simple, mobile-first UI with regional language readiness and future voice-based interactions.
